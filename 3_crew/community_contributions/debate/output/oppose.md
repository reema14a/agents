To frame abortion as a human right is to fundamentally disregard the human rights of the unborn. While bodily autonomy is a valid consideration, it cannot supersede the right to life itself, which is the most fundamental human right. Proponents of abortion rights often assert that a fetus lacks consciousness or viability, thus not warranting protection. However, the point at which life begins is a complex philosophical and scientific question, not one to be arbitrarily defined to suit particular agendas. Moreover, the potential for life is undeniable.

Furthermore, the argument that restricting abortion access disproportionately impacts marginalized communities, while highlighting an important issue of healthcare equity, does not justify ending a life. Instead, society should focus on addressing the root causes of these disparities by providing comprehensive support to pregnant individuals and families, regardless of their socioeconomic status. This includes access to prenatal care, affordable childcare, and resources that empower individuals to make informed decisions about their reproductive health.

Finally, while concerns about unsafe abortions are valid, the solution is not to enshrine abortion as a right, but rather to promote responsible sexual behavior, provide comprehensive sex education, and ensure access to contraception. Focusing on prevention and support is a more ethical and sustainable approach than advocating for a procedure that terminates a potential human life. Therefore, based on the principles of the right to life, the potential of the unborn, and the availability of alternative solutions, abortion should not be considered a human right.
