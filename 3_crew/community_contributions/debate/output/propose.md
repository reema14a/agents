To deny a person the right to choose whether or not to continue a pregnancy is a fundamental violation of their bodily autonomy. Every individual has the right to make decisions about their own body and health, free from coercion or interference by the state. Forcing someone to carry a pregnancy against their will infringes upon this right, effectively turning their body into a vessel for involuntary reproduction.

Furthermore, denying access to abortion disproportionately impacts marginalized communities, perpetuating systemic inequalities. Women of color, low-income individuals, and those in rural areas often face significant barriers to accessing reproductive healthcare. Restricting abortion access exacerbates these disparities, hindering their ability to control their reproductive lives and achieve economic and social equality.

Finally, safe and legal abortion is essential for protecting the health and well-being of individuals. When abortion is illegal or restricted, people are more likely to resort to unsafe procedures, leading to serious complications, injury, or even death. Ensuring access to safe abortion services is a matter of public health and a necessary component of comprehensive healthcare. Therefore, based on the principles of bodily autonomy, equality, and health, abortion is undeniably a human right.
